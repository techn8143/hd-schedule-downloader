# hd-schedule-downloader
Home Depot Associate Schedule Downloader Chrome extension. This lets you export your Home Depot work schedule to your calendar app of choice.

This is an extension I wrote that reads the schedule information from the MYTHDR schedule and formats it for downloading as an Outlook CSV or ICAL file.

There are fields in the extension options where you can specify the file name, the event name (what the work shift shows up as on your calendar), and the location (for getting location-based alerts re: traffic, when to leave).

DISCLAIMER: This is not affiliated with or supported by Home Depot, just a friendly associate providing a friendly tool for other associates.
